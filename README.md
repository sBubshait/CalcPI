# CalcPI
a helpful class to calculate and check digits of PI relatively fast using Gauss-Legendre algorithm and arbitary precision. For example, this class can calculate PI correct up to a million decimal digits in about 2 seconds (on my Mac Air).

# Get Started
To start, you will need to have python installed which <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"><strong>can be downloaded from here</strong></a>

Then, you can clone this repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/sBubshait/CalcPI.git
```

Finally, you can start testing in the main.py file! You can run the main.py file using the following command:
```
python main.py
```

Have fun!
